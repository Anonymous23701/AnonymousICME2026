	<h3>Evaluating and Improving Explanation Coherence for Multimodal Emotion Recognition</h3>
	</div>
	<p><b>Abstract.</b> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
                        achieve strong performance in Multimodal Emotion Recognition
                        (MER), yet accurate predictions alone do not guarantee genuine
                        emotional understanding. Explainable MER (EMER) extends
                        MER by requiring natural language explanations, but such
                        explanations are often redundant or inconsistent with predicted
                        emotions, revealing deficiencies in emotional reasoning coherence.
                        A key challenge is that coherence remains poorly defined and
                        difficult to optimize systematically. In this work, we propose
                        the <b>Fine-Grained Coherence Evaluator (FG-CE)</b>, which opera-
                        tionalizes explanation coherence as a measurable and optimizable
                        signal. FG-CE decomposes explanations into sentence-level units
                        and identifies their functional role, modality grounding, and
                        emotional consistency, producing interpretable coherence scores.
                        Building upon FG-CE, we introduce <b>Coherence-Aware EMER
                        (CA-EMER)</b>, a unified optimization framework that integrates
                        FG-CE into reinforcement learning and evaluator-guided re-
                        jection sampling, enabling coherence-aware self-improvement
                        without additional human annotations. Experiments demonstrate
                        that CA-EMER improves emotional explanation coherence while
                        preserving emotion recognition performance and generalization.

		<b>Figure 1. Overview of CA-EMER and FG-CE.</b> 
    (a) Major training stages: cold-start SFT, two-phase GRPO, FG-CE–guided rejection sampling, and a final GRPO stage identical to Phase 1, which is omitted for simplicity in the diagram.
    (b) Computation of the FG-CE score.
	</p>

    <p>
      We propose CA-EMER, a training framework that explicitly optimizes explanation coherence in MLLMs for EMER while maintaining reliable emotion recognition.
      CA-EMER consists of four stages:
      (1) <b>supervised fine-tuning (SFT)</b> on human-supervised cold-start data to acquire basic emotion recognition and generate fluent explanations, establishing a foundation for coherence optimization;
      (2) <b>FG-CE–guided Reinforcement Learning (RL)</b>, which follows an easy-to-hard strategy--first enforcing format and prediction correctness, then progressively aligning perception, reasoning, and emotion prediction via coherence reward;
      (3) <b>FG-CE–guided Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT)</b>, which filters and reconstructs high-coherence explanations to enable self-improvement in coherent emotional reasoning; and
      (4) a final RL stage, which reuses the same GRPO objective as the initial format-and-accuracy phase in (2), to restore and refine recognition performance.
      Overall, CA-EMER treats explanation coherence as an explicit optimization objective rather than an implicit byproduct of training.
      The pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1.

In the audio, the character sighs at the end of the speech, expressing feelings of helplessness and frustration.

              In the video, the screen shows a female character. In the video, she looks down with a somewhat melancholic expression on her face. Her eyes are not looking directly at the camera, suggesting that she is thinking or reminiscing about something. She touches her head with her hand, seemingly gently combing her hair. This action may indicate that she is feeling upset or distressed, as she may be reminding herself not to think too much or is expressing her pain. In the audio, the character's tone is low and conveys a sense of sadness and vulnerability. In the text, it is impossible to determine the emotional state based on the subtitle content.

In the audio, the tone is low and conveys a sense of sadness and vulnerability. In the text, the subtitle reads, "You are lying, I've been had. " This sentence may express the woman's dissatisfaction or disappointment with someone or something. Based on the woman's sad and tearful facial expression in the video clues, as well as the low tone and conveyed sense of sadness and vulnerability in the audio clues, we can infer that this sentence may carry a sense of sadness and disappointment. The woman may feel disappointed and hurt by someone's deception or lies, which aligns with the overall display of sadness and vulnerability by the woman.

In the audio, the tone is low and conveys a sense of sadness and vulnerability. In the text, the subtitle says, "You're lying, I'm here." This sentence may be spoken by the woman to someone. Based on the woman's sad facial expression and crying actions in the video clues, as well as the description of a low and vulnerable tone in the audio clues, we can infer that this sentence may carry a sense of disappointment, frustration, or sadness.
